### Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the sales of Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing features such as item type, outlet size, and item visibility, the model leverages historical sales data to generate accurate predictions that assist businesses in optimizing inventory management and sales strategies.

### Dataset

The dataset includes details about:

* Item identifiers and weights
* Fat content levels
* Item visibility
* Item type
* Outlet size, location type, and type
* Corresponding sales figures

### Objectives

* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and insights
* Preprocess the dataset by managing missing values and applying feature engineering
* Develop and train machine learning models to forecast sales
* Assess model accuracy and fine-tune parameters for improved performance

### Technologies Used

* **Programming & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
* **Data Format:** CSV files for data storage and processing
